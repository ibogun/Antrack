% Now you have to set up the system command to be run.
% For classical executables this is usually just a full path to the executable plus
% some optional arguments:
%
% tracker_command = fullfile(pwd, '..', 'examples', 'c', 'static');
%
% For MATLAB implementations there are several options. If you are using the TraX protocol
% and you are using MEX function (Linux and OSX systems only) then you have to run Matlab
% in GUI-less mode and run the script at startup (for more details check the Integration
% instructions). You can use the same form of command that can also be used in case of 
% the old integration approach:
% 
% tracker_command = '<TODO: path to Matlab installation>/bin/matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -r wrapper' % Linux and OSX version  (old approach and TraX using MEX)
% tracker_command = '<TODO: path to Matlab installation>\bin\matlab.exe -wait -minimize -nodesktop -nosplash -r wrapper' % Windows version (old approach only)
%
% If you want to use TraX protocol on Windows, or if the MEX function approach does not work,
% you can use the mwrapper executable found in trax reference implementation repository. In
% this case the command will look something like this:
%
% tracker_command = '<TODO: path to trax>\matlab\mwrapper.exe -I "<TODO: initialization script>" -U "<TODO: update script>"'
%
% For more details look at the instructions in the 
cDir='';
