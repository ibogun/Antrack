Scripts to be used with VOT{2014,2015,2016} tracking evaluation protocol
===========================================

Assume that Antrack code is located at `$Antrack`. Then [VOT toolkit](https://github.com/votchallenge/vot-toolkit) is located at `$Antrack/matlab/vot-toolkit`. Within `$Antrack/matlab/vot-toolkit` assume there is a folder initialized using the toolkit, call it `vot2015`. Then, copy `tracker_RobStruck.m` etc to the `$Antrack/matlab/vot-toolkit/vot2015/` and run it.
